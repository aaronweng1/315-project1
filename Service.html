        Assistant Math Teacher at <a class="hlinkDark" href="http://www.huahsing.com/">Hua-Hsing Chinese School</a></br>
        I worked for free at this Hua-Hsing school and it was very fulfilling to help first graders learn math. Some people dislike the idea of working with children, but I believe that most of them will change their minds if they actually got to opportunity to. I believe this enriched my experience while being a high-school student. </br></br>
        Treasurer for the <a class="hlinkDark" href="https://www.fascadallas.org/">Formosa Association of Student Cultural Ambassadors (FASCA)</a></br>
        FASCA is an organization for Taiwanese people and does a great amount of work relating to the Taiwanese culture and community. I personally participated in many musical performances, set up events such as the Dragon Boat Festival, and volunteered enough to get awarded the Presidential Service Volunteer Award for 100 hours of community service in a year. </br></br>
        Officer of the Plano Marching Band </br>
        Being an officer mostly involved being a role model for the juniors in the band. This happened through being the first ones to perform different drills that the juniors wouldn't know yet, being the loudest when it came to marking time, and more. Officers also held additional roles - mine was to inspect all uniforms and mark them down. </br></br>
        Helper at Nursing Home </br>
        I helped serve food, walk the elderly, and more as a part of my church activities as a elementary school/middle school student.
