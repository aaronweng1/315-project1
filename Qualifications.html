        Employment/Community Service Experience:</br>
        Intern Programmer for Raddian Technology LLC in Summer to Fall 2022, Learning how to deal with clients and working with a group to deliver updates to a website using HTML, Javascript, and CSS. Additional challenges included dealing with vague client requests and creating a new website based off of an old one. </br></br>
This experience was a multi-month long process which involved first attempting to create an app through Microsoft PowerApps since it was requested from the client that we use a Microsoft application to build a functional website. After about a week of work of integrating the Figma design for an app that a fellow intern created, we discovered that PowerApps couldn't be used to make a working website with a link. Afterwards, we switched to Microsoft Power Pages which worked much better for website creation. In the midst of doing this, us interns along with our manager worked together to hash out the small details of the ever-changing requests made by the client(s). In Power Pages, there are templates and elements that the program gives the user to build a website with. Additionally, the user can delve into the code itself and edit the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other types of code they put in. I spent the next several months leading my group in the website development in this application, creating every page, developing the functionality in JavaScript, and editing the UI design in CSS.
